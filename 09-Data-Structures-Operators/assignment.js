 */

/* A) Destructure the 'books' array into four variables called 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd'.
        Leave the rest of the books unused. */
// Answer:
const [a, b, c, d] = books;
console.log(a, b, c, d);

/* B) The second and third books are science fiction.
        Assign these books to the variables called 'second' and 'third' using destructuring. */
// Answer:
const [, second, third] = books;
console.log(second, third);

/* C) The getBooksByGenre() function returns an array of books based on the genre you pass as the argument.
        Use it to get all 'fantasy' books. Destructure the returned array into two variables ‚Äî the first one called 'theLordOfTheRings',
        and the second one called 'otherFantasyBooks' (an array containing all other values from the returned array). */
// Answer:
const [theLordOfTheRings, ...otherFantasyBooks] = getBooksByGenre("fantasy");
console.log(theLordOfTheRings, ...otherFantasyBooks);

/* D) Are you ready for some hard-core destructuring? üòÑ
        The getBooksAsArrays() function returns the books array, but all book objects and their properties were converted to arrays.
        Now, you have an array of arrays of arrays.
        Destructure the title of the second book (The Cyberiad) into a variable called 'title'. */
// Answer:
const [, [[, title]]] = getBooksAsArrays();
console.log(title);

 *  ********************************************
 */

/* A) Take the first object from the 'books' array, and assign the author to the 'author' variable using destructuring.
 *     Use the 'let' statement because the 'author' variable may change later. */
// Answer:
let { author } = books[0];
console.log(author);

/* B) Take the second object from the 'books' array, and destructure the title into a variable called 'bookTitle'. */
// Answer:
const { title: bookTitle } = books[1];
console.log(bookTitle);

/* C) The book objects aren't consistent in their form.
        For example, the second book doesn't have the 'filmAdaptation' property.
        Destructure it into a variable called 'hasFilmAdaptation' with a default value of false. */
// Answer:
const { hasFilmAdaptation = false } = books[1];
console.log(books[1]);

/* D) Remember the 'author' variable from exercise A? It's time to reassign it.
        Destructure the author of the third book into existing variable called 'author'. */
// Answer:
const authorThirdBook = books[2];

({ author } = authorThirdBook);
console.log(author);

 *  3) THE SPREAD SYNTAX                       *
 *  ********************************************
 */

/* A) The getBookAuthors() function returns an array of authors from the 'books' array.
        Reassign the 'authors' variable below so that it contains both ‚Äî already existing authors,
        and authors returned from the getBookAuthors() function. Use the spread syntax. */
// Answer:
let authors = ["George Orwell", "Aldous Huxley", ...getBookAuthors()];

/* B) The console.log() method can take multiple arguments and log them to the console.
First, log the 'authors' array as it is (as one argument).
Second, log the elements of the 'authors' array, but this time use the spread syntax.
Compare the outputs. */
// Answer:
console.log(authors);
console.log(...authors);

/* C) The spread syntax can be used with other iterables, for example, strings.
        Create a new variable called 'firstNameArray', and spread the 'firstName' string
        so that each letter becomes an element of the 'firstNameArray' like ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n']. */
// Answer:
const firstName = "John";
console.log([...firstName]);

/* D) Now it's time to spread some objects. Create a new variable called 'cyberiad',
        and assign an object to it. This object should have all the properties of the second book from the 'books' array,
        plus the missing 'filmAdaptation' property set to false. */
// Answer:
const cyberiad = { ...books[1], filmAdaptation: false };
console.log(cyberiad);
